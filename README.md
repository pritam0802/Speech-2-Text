# Speech-2-Text

**Speech-2-text**
app is a type of application that effectively takes audio content and transcribes it into written words in a word processor or other display destination. This type of speech recognition app is extremely valuable to anyone who needs to generate a lot of written content without a lot of manual typing. It is also useful for people with disabilities that make it difficult for them to use a keyboard.

Most speech-2-text software programs aimed at assisting with transcription focus on recognizing a wide range of vocabulary from a single user or a limited set of users, rather than recognizing a smaller range of vocabulary from a larger user base.
